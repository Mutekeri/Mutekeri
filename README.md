My focus is on Data Science: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning. Whereby the basics for creating algorithms are from Matlab/Octave. Then move to develop models in Tensorflow 2.0 using platforms like Anaconda, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebooks. I have worked on different projects as MS SQL DBA (+5years) for many companies like Sorbet, We fix computers, Sun international, Sambe Consulting and other companies we had contracts with as a consultant. Whereby my main emphasis will be to organize and develop a system which is conducive to the modelling of the systems in order to produce ideal Business Intelligence system. That is database design, working with relational database management system (RDBMS) from Microsoft designed for the enterprise environment. Using SQL Server features to standard SQL, including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables, user control. can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
